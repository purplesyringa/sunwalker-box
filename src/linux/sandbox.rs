    // it disabled for now.
    //
    // The second reason is that enabling it not as easy as flicking a switch. Linux collects
    // statistics on network interfaces, so network interfaces have to be re-created every time
    // to prevent data leaks. The lo interface is unique in the way that it always exists in
    // the netns and can't be deleted or recreated, according to a comment in Linux kernel:
    //     The loopback device is special if any other network devices
    //     is present in a network namespace the loopback device must
    //     be present. Since we now dynamically allocate and free the
    //     loopback device ensure this invariant is maintained by
    //     keeping the loopback device as the first device on the
    //     list of network devices.  Ensuring the loopback devices
    //     is the first device that appears and the last network device
    //     that disappears.
    //
    // However, we can create a dummy interface and assign the local addresses to it rather than lo.
    // It would still have to be re-created, though, and that takes precious time, 50 ms for me. And
    // then there is a problem with IPv6--::1 cannot be assigned to anything but lo due to a quirk
    // in the interpretation of the IPv6 RFC by the Linux kernel.

    // We don't need to bring lo down explicitly because unsharing netns does that for us
